		<h1>NorCal Spring Hacks 2023</h1>
		<h3>Bringing community together from coders, to engineers, to writers, and of course speedcubers. And of course, we can't forget about our fundraiser portion of the hackathon.</h3>
		<h2>February 11-13 2023</h2>
		<h2 id="about_us">About Us</h2>
		<p>We're Northern California Hacks, a non-profit dedicated to bring people together and building communities. We plan to host various activities and competitions.</p>
		<p>Our hackathon is the first of its series, and is also the first hosted by Northern California Hacks. The goal of this hackathon is to engage a larger community into stem and literature, and helping others in the process.</p>
		<h2 id='brackets'>Brakets:</h2>
		<p>We have designed this hackathon around a bracket system, meaning that each bracket is its own competition. We will have the following brackets:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Coding</li>
			<li>Steam</li>
			<li>Literature</li>
			<li>Speed Cubing</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 id="fundraiser">Fundraiser:</h2>
		<p>We'll also have a fundraiser for a charity so we can make a real impact on the world. During the livstream, we will create a project to help the charity, and we will present it to them as a surprise at the end.</p>
